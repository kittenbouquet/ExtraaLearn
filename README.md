# ExtraaLearn
This project uses machine learning to predict customer conversions with a Decision Tree and Random Forest model, then compares them. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to provide insights for optimizing customer acquisition and retention for this fictional company.

--------

## Project Overview

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned and prepared by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and engineering new features.
- **Modeling**: A **Random Forest** model was trained to predict customer conversions. We also explored a **Decision Tree** model as a baseline.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance was assessed using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**. Insights from the model were used to provide recommendations for improving customer acquisition and retention.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and feature engineering.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained using **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed performance metrics to evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Actionable Insights**: Insights from the model were used to make recommendations for improving customer acquisition strategies.

## Results

The **Random Forest** model achieved an **accuracy of 81%**, providing valuable insights into which features are most important for predicting customer conversion. Key factors like **website visits** and **profile completion** were identified as strong predictors.

## Recommendations

Based on the model's insights, the following recommendations were made:
- Target high-engagement users for marketing efforts.
- Improve profile completion to boost conversion rates.
- Experiment with customer re-engagement strategies to recover missed opportunities.
